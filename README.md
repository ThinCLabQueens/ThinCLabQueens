Welcome to the official repository for the Thought in Context lab at Queen's University.


## When submitting code to this repository, please try to adhere to these standards:

1. Please clearly label all file names.
2. Include a README.md file for each upload which roughly describes the code/data.

## **For python scripts:**
1. Please include your name at the top of key scripts.
2. Include all imports at the top of your script. 
3. If your script is meant to run on it's own, i.e. it is not solely referenced by other scripts, please put the entire script into a function, and call it with: 
  ```
  if __name__ == "__main__": 
    function()
  ```
  You can find an example of this [here](https://github.com/ThinCLabQueens/ThinCLabQueens/blob/main/example.py)
